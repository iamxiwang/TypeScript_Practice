# TypeScript
## Instructions

Finish filling out the basics.ts file in the Practice-problems, and then proceed to solve the rest of the problems.<br />
After finishing each file, check the generated code by the TypeScript compiler in the corresponding JavaScript file.<br />
Command to compile ts code - tsc filename.ts<br />
Command to compile ts and run javascript code - ts-node filename.ts<br />

If you want to keep your TypeScript code and Javascript code separate, put all your typescript files in the "src" folder and then configure tsConfig.json.

When you complete all other practice problems, you can find further practice here: https://typescript-exercises.github.io/
Many of the exercises from this repository will require that you do further research
